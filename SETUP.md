## Prerequisites Check

Before running the application, ensure you have:

1. ‚úÖ **Java JDK 17 or higher** - You have Java 23 installed
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **MySQL 8.0+** - Please install if not already installed
3. ‚úÖ **Maven** - Maven wrapper (mvnw.cmd) is included in the project

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Install MySQL (if not installed)

Download and install MySQL from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

If you want to use different credentials:
1. Open `src/main/resources/application.properties`
2. Update these lines:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

### 3. Build the Project

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd clean install
```

### 4. Run the Application

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on http://localhost:8080

### 5. Access the Application

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select:
   - "Build Project" to compile
   - "Run Application" to start the server

## Troubleshooting

### Java Version Issues
- Ensure JAVA_HOME environment variable is set
- Java 17 or higher is required
