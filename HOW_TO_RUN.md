## üìã STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Verify MySQL is Running ‚úÖ
You already completed this! MySQL service is running.

---

### STEP 2: Build the Project

**Open PowerShell terminal in VS Code** (you should already be in PROJECT8 folder)

Run:
```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd clean install -DskipTests
```

**What this does:**
- Downloads all dependencies (first time only)
- Compiles Java code
- Creates JAR file
- Takes 1-2 minutes

**Expected output:**
```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

**If you see errors, run:**
```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd clean
.\mvnw.cmd install -DskipTests
```

---

### STEP 3: Run the Application

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

**What to look for:**
- Wait for: `Started ExpenseTrackerApplication in X seconds`
- Server will run on port 8080

**The terminal will show:**
```
...
: Started ExpenseTrackerApplication in 5.234 seconds
```

**DO NOT CLOSE THIS TERMINAL!** The server needs to keep running.

---

### STEP 4: Open the Application in Browser

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2. Go to: **http://localhost:8080**
3. You should see the Expense Tracker interface!

2. Type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select "Build Project"

### To Run:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select "Run Application"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Port 8080 is already in use"

**Solution 1:** Stop the other application using port 8080

**Solution 2:** Change port:
1. Open `src/main/resources/application.properties`
2. Change `server.port=8080` to `server.port=8081`
3. Update `API_BASE_URL` in `src/main/resources/static/js/app.js` to `http://localhost:8081/api/expenses`
4. Rebuild and run
5. Open `http://localhost:8081` in browser

---

###Problem: "Cannot connect to database"

**Check:**
1. MySQL service is running:
   ```powershell
   Get-Service MySQL* | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq 'Running'}
   ```

2. Password is correct in `application.properties`:
   ```
   spring.datasource.password=Root123654S08
   ```

3. MySQL is on port 3306

**Fix MySQL:**
```powershell
net start MySQL80
```

---

### Problem: Build fails with "Cannot find symbol"

**Solution:**
```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd clean
.\mvnw.cmd install -DskipTests -U
```

The `-U` forces Maven to update dependencies.

---

### Problem: Frontend doesn't load

1. **Clear browser cache**: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
2. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl+F5`
3. **Check console**: Press `F12` in browser, look for errors

---
